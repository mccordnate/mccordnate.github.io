Hello all.

Welcome to my first post on my personal blog!

You can find an explanation of me in my about page linked at the top (what's the point of reposting?)

As of right now, this blog is hosted on Github pages using Jekyll. That means I'm writing this post in markdown which I actually gained a lot of experience with this past summer. So that's pretty neat.

##The Big Question

There's one big question I'm currently trying to understand the answer to through this blog.

>At what point is someone qualified enough to write a blog post about something?

Currently, I'm not really sure when someone decides they can teach others about something. It would seem that one needs a good understanding, however, teaching something is one of the best ways to learn it meaning that sooner rather than later might be better. **Be ready for some experimentation.**

Well, that's all really. I wanted to keep things brief to not scare people off. Thanks for making it through this. Time for a fun and wild ride (Hopefully, I've never done a good job keeping up with blogging in the past).
