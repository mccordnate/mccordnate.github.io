Hey there,

I think it's time to tell everyone a little bit about this semester. This is a blog post I knew I would have to write when creating this blog. It's quite possibly, subconsciously, the reason I made this blog. As you can see, I had a lot to get off my chest.

As some of you may know, I took this semester off from college. To many friends I don't think it came as a surprise as every semester I would inevitably end up making it two-thirds of the way through before falling into a slump of "please get me out of this god awful place I can't stand it."

Most of the time I would end up having some dream of a startup that could make me rich. I felt that school was wasting my time to accomplish things. Well I decided it was time to just try taking some time off and see where it goes, the only thing is, I didn't actually have an idea in mind at the time.

So then, **why do it?**

I've asked myself that question many times in the past couple of months. The amount of times that someone asked "how are classes going?" didn't help. Don't forget the awkward, distant stares combined with "so... your projects..."

All of this made it easy to feel like an outcast. Easy to question my choices. While the current generation loves shows like Silicon Valley and praises drop-outs like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, it still doesn't understand why *you* would drop out. It's so counter-cultural. It's so strange. Can't you just goto school and get a job like everyone else?

I took a semester off with the intent to re-enroll from the beginning, and currently I'm just waiting for registration to open for me as my intent to come back has already been accepted. So what was the point? Isn't that just delaying the inevitable.

Yes.

But it still offered me many opportunities to learn things I wouldn't have learned if I was still in school. Here's a list of things I've done / am doing this semester:

- Got my health together. Part of the reason that I end up feeling so shitty through the semester is my health wanes. It's been pretty bad since sometime during the middle of high school when I increased my workload tremendously, started eating worse and just completely raised my stress levels. But had I not taken this semester off, how would I adjust to the paleo diet I just started? How would I deal with the affects of many different supplements I've experimented with. (what can I say? I like biohacking)

- Furthering the above point, I've been on a consistent workout schedule with my roommate. It feels amazing. And there's been definite progress. There's still so much left before I reach my current goals. Fitness is a lifelong thing and it's awesome to have finally started getting it together (even if sometimes it feels like I was a little late to the game)

- I started lots of projects. And I mean lots. I prototyped one successfully. Most I only made it far enough to learn a bit about a new technology and get bored. What did I learn from this? How much passion means to me. I don't want to work on something that doesn't excite me. It's very obvious that some of my friends haven't really enjoyed my project ADD but to me it makes sense. I still don't know what I want to do, but I'm a heck of a lot closer after trying so many different technologies and ideas. Which brings me to my next point.

- I realized that when I come back to school I'd like to head down the intelligence track which includes courses like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. It makes a lot of sense to me. But it only made sense after becoming extremely passionate about a project that combines fitness with computer vision. It's a hard problem, I can't solve it right now. That much is apparent. But in the future, who knows? This field aligns with other values in my life as well. I've spent a good portion of my life wishing to optimize learning. Why do we spend time learning subjects and not time learning how to learn in school? If we could read faster, learn better, we could grow so much more efficiently. So why not teach computers how to learn? Not to mention AI is becoming an increasingly big part of our lives everyday as computers become more and more powerful.

- I interviewed with companies and accepted an offer with a company that I've always wanted to work at. I'd like to write a blog post in the future talking more about this. But for now, I'll leave it at that. I do have to say, not having classes made it much easier to prepare for interviews and not stress out as much.

- Not everything I did was productive. It was weird trrying to adjust to a schedule when I could make my own. Some days I did great work. Some days I did none. I can say with certainty I spent more days in the library this semester than I did in my past years at college combined. But I can say I have spent time being disappointed with my work output. I had all the time in the world for a few months, did I waste it? Sometimes I wanted to say yes. But then I think about all the things I learned. All the things that can be learned from wasted time.

Maybe I don't run a billion dollar company now. But I feel a lot more whole. I have a better understanding of where I'm at. The transition back into school will certaintly be interesting. It'll feel weird at times. I'll get annoyed that I'm going through with it. I'll miss this freedom. But overall, I think this time spent doing and not doing makes me understand a lot better where to go from here.
